# DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN OF SERVICES THAT HELP IMPROVE YOUR ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE USING SOA Architecture.

# Abstract

Itâ€™s hard to find a market that has been more shaken up by the popularity of the internet than commerce. From mom and pop shops in your local area to retail giants, online shopping has completely changed the game when it  comes to convincing shoppers to purchase goods from physical stores or even when it's presented as a digital content such as online courses. And with this change of events, the competition between the companies had skyrocket pushing them to use all kinds of strategies for their clients which have no way of defending themselves. Here we present two services which can be used by the client application: the first can check for the availability of coupons for an item, the second can be set to notify the client for when an item's price has gotten reduced bellow a thresh hold, and then we would be writing a browser extention that would invoke and use our web services.
